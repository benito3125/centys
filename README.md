# Censys Postman
A Postman collection for Censys, covering all existing APIs.

# How to use

The Postman Collection file is a JSON containing all information about each request. This Collection is using Postman Environment Variables, so all you have to do is create an Environment at your Postman and register the Postman variables, which are:

* CENSYS_API_ID
* CENSYS_API_SECRET

To learn more about Postman variables: https://www.getpostman.com/docs/environments

Once you register the required variables for your store, you will be able to use the whole Collection.
